    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Red red! A Ghanaian comfort dish like no other. It is very simple to make, very tasty, and filling. This is a simplified version with no protein or too many additional ingredients that is sometimes added to red red (like dried shrimp or fish). No blender needed or any special in gradients except of course the key ingredient palm oil. Before criticizing West African use of this ingredients I suggest you read article by Yewande Komolafe for a more wholistic vies of the situation.
